1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
All right, let's dive into this lexical analysis thing.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,960
Sounds good.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,800
Yeah, you've sent over some pretty heavy material,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,760
definitely the kind of stuff that you'd normally find

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,400
in like a compiler design textbook.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,240
Right, right.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,760
But we're gonna make this clear,

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,560
even if you've never heard of lexical analysis before.

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,400
Oh, exactly.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,600
By the end of this deep dive,

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,640
you're gonna be able to talk about it confidently.

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,600
Absolutely, and we're gonna really break down

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,160
those complexities so you can understand

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
the core principles.

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,000
So.
