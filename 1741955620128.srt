1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Keep careful watch of my brother's souls

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Keep watching over your insides

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If this is to end in fire

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Then we shall all burn together

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Watch the flames climb high into the night

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Calling out Father O

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Stand by and we will watch the flames burn

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oven on the mountainside

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And if we should die tonight

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Then we should all die together

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Raise a glass of wine

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For the last time

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Calling out Father O

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Prepare as we will

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Watch the flames burn

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oven on the mountainside

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Desolation comes upon the sky

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now I see fire

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Inside the mountain I see fire

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Burning the trees and I see fire

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hollow in soul I see fire

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Blood in the breeze

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I hope that you remember me

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, should my people fold in

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Surely I'll do the same

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Come find in mountain holes

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We got too close to the flame

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Calling out Father O

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hold fast and we will

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Watch the flames burn

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oven on the mountainside

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Desolation comes upon the sky

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now I see fire

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Inside the mountain I see fire

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Burning the trees and I see fire

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hollow in soul I see fire

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Blood in the breeze

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I hope that you remember me

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And if the night is burning

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I will cover my eyes

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
For if the dark wind turns

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Then my brothers will die

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And as the sky is falling down

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It crushed into this lonely town

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And with that shadow upon the ground

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I hear my people screaming now

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now I see fire

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Inside the mountain I see fire

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Burning the trees and I see fire

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hollow in soul I see fire

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Blood in the breeze I see fire

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, you know it's on a city burn

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And I see fire

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Feel the heat upon my skin

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And I see fire

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And I see fire burn

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oven on the mountainside
