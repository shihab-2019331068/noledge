1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Run it down, then sign it up So run it down, get your money up

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I put money down on all of us On my people now, on what I love

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ooh, baby, it's dangerous Your problems are just not the same to us

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're dealing with things you ain't seen before We're feeling the weight of our instances

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're hailing our ways that don't last a long Don't happen the time in the diabetes

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No help for the weak, but the lick is strong Plenty here, boy, for all of us

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now bring out the drums and the bitch On my homies got restoration that I said wouldn't work

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Bring out the guns and the bitch Here to load up a clip, I'm gon' show up in a place with a car

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I see the bums, I be wishing we ending the ditch Here to playin' and see I'm at heart

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I see the love that we giving, the love that we getting Sure everything comin' for zero

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We're from nothin' to something Got all of a job and that shit that we made from the air

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're in front runnin' and gunnin' With nothin' to stop it, they're beatin' the neighborhood bruh

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They ain't a person alive, they be matchin' the vibe And they honestly ain't even bad

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
They're in the door with the drive And the vision like I haven't lost sight

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go look in the mirror, babe So run it up, the sun is up

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
To run it down, get your money up I put money down, on all of us

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
On my people now, on what I love Ooh, baby, we run it up

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, they demand that the sun is up There's no rest, do we run it down

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're different, we got your money up But leave it like I put money down

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm bettin' the odds on all of us I do it for all of my people now

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Put that up, everything that I love Yeah, on everything that I love

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, ain't nothin' that come up up

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now we go from angry and mad to happy and glad To find a solution for us

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We go from sorry inside to ready to grab our weapons And get to the punch

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want the money, the cash, the mule, the bag, the currency, stacking it up

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We want the freedom, the labor, the freedom to have The things we'll be lackin' my brush

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So what are we lackin'? I could point it down, so much that's around

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Bet I'll settle down, no point doin' that All they send the hounds, bite me in the eyes

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Put me in the ground, tell me in the eyes, come to carry down

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
From those who came up before me I made a change out the story

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Find me at work and I'm on it Find me with people I'm on it, man

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Your death is around every corner When life isn't free for a person, dark

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You act like an animal corner Savage is speaking a language, oh

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You don't understand your corner So nobody need an advantage

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now we need a balance and order But you know there's never that case

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Never a chance that they're changing their ways There's never a choice that they're giving to you

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, we'll never be just as a phase We sing for the sorrow and dance for the pain

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You're one to follow, it's just you and me I swear that it's coming, we startin' the day

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But we'll wake up tomorrow and things are the same, die

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I mean it, what did I tell you the fuck you do?
