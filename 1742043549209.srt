1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Maybe I was wrong and you were right

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,600
But I don't really wanna have this fight

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,600
I just wanna feel like I belong

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,600
And every time my heart sings back to you

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,600
You are my morning and my truth

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,600
I know that I can do is sing this song

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,600
It ain't that long

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,200
And nothing says I love you like your eyes

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
From my lips with carbon dioxide

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
I just wanna feel like I deserve you

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Cause you deserve me

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Maybe it's the way that you can see

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,200
What I'm missing, what I can never be

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
I just wanna feel like I deserve you

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Cause you deserve me

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Maybe you were wrong and I was right

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
But I don't care, won't you stay another night?

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,200
I just need some time to be myself

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,200
I couldn't say I need you on that night

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,200
When you left and I lost all track of time

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,200
I just want you close so I can feel you

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Can you feel me?

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,200
And nothing says I love you like the words that were never said

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,200
If only there was peace around us baby

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,200
You would hear me

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,200
And maybe it's the way that lovers do

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I just want for me, what I want for you

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Only with the sun above us maybe

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,200
You would see me

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,200
And even if you leave I may be fine

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Cause my heart, it has its own design

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,200
And even if you never see it baby

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
You're all that I need

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,200
Maybe it's the silence in your eyes

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Maybe it's the light like when you're shy

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Maybe it's the mystery of your love

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,200
All I need is a sign from the stars above

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Maybe it's the way that you breathe

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Maybe it's the man that you see in me

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Maybe it's the fragrance of your hair

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,200
I just want to kiss you when you're there

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
I just want you all around me baby

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Can we make that happen please?
